<h2 align="center">About</h2>
Nest+ is a React JS based social network web application that allows users to create and search for posts with the ability to upload image/video file. Users can choose either search by keyword or username to view posts, which is supported by ElasticSearch to render relevant results. The application was designed to be a single-page application to dynamically render contents of data fetched from server without the need to reload the entire page. React Router was utilized to handle the URLs. The front-end UI design was developed with React. The server functions were developed in Go to handle client requests, and provide token-based authentication using JWT.

 Demo
---
It is a great experience of diving into Cloud based development using virtual machines. Due to the concern of uncertain high costs of using Google Cloud, I decided to make a demo video to demonstrate the key features of this project before shutting down my App.
