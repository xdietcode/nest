# Nest+: a Cloud Based Social Network 

Nest+ is a Cloud based social network web application that allows users to create fun posts with photos. Users can choose to search by keyword or username to view posts, which is supported by ElasticSearch to render relevant results. The application was designed to be a single-page application to dynamically display contents of data fetched from server without the need to reload the entire page. The front-end UI design was developed with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. The server functions were developed in Golang and deployed to Google Cloud to handle HTTP requests and responses, and perform token-based authentication using JWT.

## Tech/Languages

Front-End: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Back-End:  Go, ElasticSearch

Deployment: Docker, Google Cloud (Google App Engine)

It is a great experience of diving into Cloud based development using virtual machines. Due to the uncertainty of high costs of using GAE, I will present a demo video to demonstrate the key features of this project.
