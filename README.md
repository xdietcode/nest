# Nest+: a Cloud Based Social Network 

Nest+ is a Cloud based social network web application that allows users to create and search for posts with the ability to upload image/video file. Users can choose either search by keyword or username to view posts, which is supported by ElasticSearch to render relevant results. The application was designed to be a single-page application to dynamically display contents of data fetched from server without the need to reload the entire page. React Router was utilized to handle the URLs. The front-end UI design was developed with React. The server functions were developed in Go to handle HTTP requests and responses, and perform token-based authentication using JWT.

## Tech/Languages

Front-End: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Back-End:  Go, ElasticSearch

Deployment: Docker, Google Cloud (Google App Engine)


 Demo

It is a great experience of diving into Cloud based development using virtual machines. Due to the concern of uncertain high costs of using Google Cloud, I decided to make a demo video to demonstrate the key features of this project before shutting down my App.
