# Nest+: a Cloud Based Social Network Web Application

Nest+ is a Cloud based social network web application that allows users to create fun posts with photos. Users can choose to search by keyword or username to view posts. When user is logged in, the main page will display thumbnails of posts created by all users. Users can browse posts by clicking on the photos.

The application was designed to be a single-page application to dynamically display contents of data fetched from server without the need to reload the entire page. The front-end UI design was developed with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. The server functions were developed in Golang and deployed to Google App Engine to handle HTTP requests and responses, store posts metadata using ElasticSearch, and perform token-based authentication using JWT.

## Tech/Languages

Front-End: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Back-End:  Go, ElasticSearch

Deployment: Docker, Google Cloud (Google App Engine)


 Demo
---
It is a great experience of using AWS and GCP for deployment. Due to the concern of high costs of using cloud services, I will present a demo video to demonstrate the key features of this project.
